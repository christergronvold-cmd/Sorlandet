# Where is Sørlandet? 🚢

A small page for families following the school ship **Sørlandet** (MMSI 257165000):
where she is, where she has sailed, and what the weather and sea are like at her
actual position.

No server to look after. **GitHub Actions** fetches the position every 20 minutes and
stores it in this repository; **GitHub Pages** serves the page. Free, and everyone only
needs one link.

```
index.html                    the page (map + position + weather)
data/latest.json              last position and weather   <- written by the script
data/track.json               every position so far (the track itself)
data/ports.json               the 2026-2027 voyage plan (ports, dates, coordinates)
scripts/update.py             fetches AIS position + weather
scripts/seed_demo.py          writes sample data so you can preview the page
.github/workflows/update.yml  runs update.py every 20 minutes
vendor/leaflet/               the map library, kept local so the page is self-contained
```

## Setup, in this order (about 15 minutes)

### 1. Get a free AIS key

Go to [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io), sign in with GitHub, and create an API key
under *Account*. Free, no card required.

### 2. Create the repository

New repository, name it whatever you like, and make it **Public** — free GitHub Pages
only works on public repositories. That is fine here: AIS positions are public
information and the page contains nothing about the students.

### 3. Upload the files — all at once

*Add file → Upload files*, then drag in **the contents** of this folder (not the folder
itself). Do it in a single commit.

Two files will not come along, because macOS Finder and Windows Explorer hide names that
start with a dot. Create them in the browser instead — GitHub creates folders for you
when you type a slash in the name field:

| *Add file → Create new file* → name | Content |
|---|---|
| `.nojekyll` | leave completely empty |
| `.github/workflows/update.yml` | paste from the file in this folder |

`.nojekyll` matters: without it, Pages runs the site through Jekyll, a blog engine this
project does not use, and the build fails.

### 4. Add the key as a secret

*Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret*

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` | the key from step 1 |

The key belongs here and nowhere else — never in a file in the repository.

### 5. Turn on Pages

*Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch `main`, folder `/ (root)` → Save*

After a few minutes the green box at the top shows **Your site is live at …**. That is
the link you share.

### 6. Run it once

*Actions → Update position → Run workflow.* Nothing else starts on its own, so you can
read the log in peace. Open the step *Fetch position and weather*:

| Log line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-> position 58.7…, 5.2…` | working, and the ship was within range of a receiver |
| `-> no AIS message in this window` | working, but no receiver heard her. Normal at sea |
| `* no AISSTREAM_API_KEY` | the secret is missing or misspelled |
| `! aisstream returned an error` | the key was rejected — check for stray spaces |

From then on it runs by itself every 20 minutes, and the track grows a little each day.

> **Tip:** open the link on a phone and choose *Add to Home Screen*. It then behaves like
> a small app with its own icon.

## What to know about AIS

AIS is the ship's own radio transmitter, and the messages are picked up by **shore-based**
receivers. In practice:

* **Near coast and in port:** a new position almost every run.
* **Mid-Atlantic:** nothing, often for days. That is not a fault. The page says so
  plainly, keeps the last known position, and draws the gap dashed on the map once
  coverage returns.

The longest silence on this voyage will be **13–29 December**, Mindelo to Fernando de
Noronha. Continuous tracking across an ocean requires satellite AIS, which costs money
(Datalastic, MarineTraffic, VesselFinder and others). The script is written so such a
source can be added as an alternative inside `fetch_position_from_aisstream` without
touching anything else.

The foundation also runs its own position page, linked from
[fullriggeren.no](https://en.fullriggeren.no/) under *Follow the ship* — worth comparing
against.

## Running it locally

```bash
python3 scripts/seed_demo.py          # sample data, no key needed
python3 -m http.server 8000           # open http://localhost:8000

pip install -r requirements.txt
export AISSTREAM_API_KEY=your-key
python3 scripts/update.py             # real position + weather
```

Opening `index.html` straight from disk shows an empty page: browsers refuse to read the
`data/*.json` files that way. The small web server above is the fix.

## The route, 2026-2027

Taken from the *2026-2027 Voyage Plan* (A+ World Academy, dated 25 March 2026) and stored
in `data/ports.json`. The page uses it to show the current leg, distance and estimated
arrival, and draws the whole route on the map.

| Port | Dates |
|---|---|
| Kristiansand, Norway | departure 17 Aug 2026 |
| Lerwick, United Kingdom | 7–10 Sep |
| Dublin, Ireland | 16–20 Sep |
| St. Malo, France | 26 Sep – 2 Oct |
| Vigo, Spain | 10–14 Oct |
| Funchal, Madeira | 22–28 Oct |
| Sevilla, Spain | 5–10 Nov |
| Las Palmas, Gran Canaria | 18 Nov – 4 Dec (parent teacher conferences 19 Nov) |
| Mindelo, Cape Verde | 13–17 Dec |
| Fernando de Noronha, Brazil | 29 Dec – 2 Jan |
| Paramaribo, Suriname | 15–20 Jan 2027 |
| Bridgetown, Barbados | 26 Jan – 1 Feb |
| St. Martin, France | 5–9 Feb |
| Charleston, USA | 24 Feb – 2 Mar |
| New York City, USA | 9–24 Mar (parent teacher conferences 10 Mar) |
| Horta, Azores | 14–18 Apr |
| Scheveningen, Netherlands | 2–18 May (AP exams) |
| Skagen, Denmark | 25–28 May |
| Kristiansand, Norway | graduation 29 May 2027 |

The plan is tentative. If dates change, edit `data/ports.json` and the page follows.
Coordinates are approximate port positions — good enough for distance and estimates.

## Data sources

| What | Where | Key |
|---|---|---|
| Position, speed, course | [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io) (WebSocket) | free key |
| Waves, swell, sea temperature | [Open-Meteo Marine](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/marine-weather-api) | none |
| Wind, temperature, pressure, forecast | [Open-Meteo Forecast](https://open-meteo.com) | none |
| Map tiles | OpenStreetMap | none |

Open-Meteo is free for non-commercial use. Norwegian waters can additionally be read from
the [BarentsWatch/Kystverket AIS API](https://developer.barentswatch.no/docs/category/ais/)
if you want denser updates while the ship is home.

## Ideas for later

* **Notifications** — a job that emails or pushes when the ship reappears in AIS coverage,
  or is within X nautical miles of the next port.
* **Weekly summary** — distance covered and highest wave last week, sent every Sunday.
* **Photos** — a small gallery per port, if the students share pictures.

This is a private family project. It is not an official source from the ship, the
foundation or the school, and the ship's own page always takes precedence.
